### School Project: Enhanced Tamagotchi Simulation

During my coursework, I embarked on an engaging project to develop an advanced Tamagotchi simulation. This assignment not only aimed at honing our class's object-oriented programming skills but also at incorporating elements of real-world interaction and manipulation of digital entities.

Fueled by enthusiasm for the challenge and a keen interest in deepening my understanding of inheritance and polymorphism, I leveraged approximately 60% of the foundational concepts provided by the GPT framework. Additionally, I sought the expertise of seasoned developers, which constituted about 10% of the project's development process. This collaborative effort resulted in a sophisticated Tamagotchi game that allows players to uniquely customize each virtual pet. The game features intricate mechanisms for managing the pets' needs, such as eating, playing, and sleeping, thereby providing a rich and interactive user experience.

This project not only allowed me to explore and apply advanced programming techniques but also significantly contributed to my proficiency in utilizing subclasses and extending functionalities within a software development context.
